- Track cashflow and payment timing across platforms

### 3.2 What Zerithum Does NOT Do

We want to be crystal clear about what we are NOT:


- **Not a payment processor**: We never process, hold, or transfer your money
- **Not a bank or financial institution**: We do not provide banking services

Zerithum is accounting software. We observe and report on your financial data but never touch your money. All payments flow directly from your Content Platforms to your bank account. We simply help you see, track, and reconcile those earnings.
